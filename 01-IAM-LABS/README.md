# üìù Practice Exercises

## üéØ Learning Approach

**Progressive Learning Path**: These exercises are designed to be completed progressively, not all at once. Each section builds upon the previous one, requiring specific knowledge and skills that are developed through the exercises.

**How to use this lab:**
- **Start with Easy exercises** to build a solid foundation
- **Complete at least 6-8 Easy exercises** before moving to Intermediate
- **Master Intermediate concepts** before attempting Hard exercises
- **Focus on understanding** rather than rushing through exercises
- **Take breaks** between sections to consolidate learning

**Remember**: Each section has minimum requirements. Don't skip ahead - the knowledge you gain in earlier exercises is essential for success in more advanced scenarios.

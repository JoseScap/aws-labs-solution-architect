#### ‚úÖ Checklist:
- [ ] Research security group management permissions
- [ ] Understand the difference between rule modification and group management
- [ ] Research how to implement granular permission restrictions
- [ ] Implement policy allowing rule changes but preventing group management

---

### 8. **S3 Bucket Accessible Only via Role**

Create a policy so that **only a specific role** (e.g., `FinanceRole`) can upload files to the `finance-reports` bucket.

#### ‚úÖ Checklist:

- [ ] Understand role-based access control in S3
- [ ] Research how to specify role principals in bucket policies
- [ ] Implement bucket policy with role-specific access
- [ ] Test access with the specified role and verify others are denied

---

### 9. **Tag-Based Access in VPC**

Allow a **group** to manage subnets, but only if they have the tag `"Environment": "Dev"`.

#### ‚úÖ Checklist:
- [ ] Research tag-based access control in AWS
- [ ] Understand EC2 subnet management permissions
- [ ] Research how to implement resource tag conditions
- [ ] Implement policy with tag-based restrictions
- [ ] Test operations on resources with and without required tags

---

### 10. **Deny Bucket Access Except for One User**

Create an **explicit denial policy** for all users in a group, except one (`JuanDev`), who should be able to access the bucket.

#### ‚úÖ Checklist:
- [ ] Research explicit deny policies and their precedence
- [ ] Understand username-based access control conditions
- [ ] Research how to implement user exceptions in deny policies
- [ ] Implement deny policy with user exception
- [ ] Test access for both the exception user and group members

---

### 11. **S3 Access Only with MFA Enabled**

Allow a **user** to access S3 objects only if they logged in with MFA.

#### ‚úÖ Checklist:
- [ ] Research MFA implementation in AWS IAM
- [ ] Understand MFA-based access control conditions
- [ ] Research how to configure MFA for users
- [ ] Implement policy requiring MFA authentication
- [ ] Test access with and without MFA enabled

---

### 12. **Internet Gateways Management**

A **network role** should be able to attach and detach internet gateways to a VPC, but not create or delete them.

#### ‚úÖ Checklist:
- [ ] Research internet gateway management permissions
- [ ] Understand the difference between gateway lifecycle and attachment operations
- [ ] Research how to implement selective permission grants

# üìù Practice Exercises

## üéØ Learning Approach

**Progressive Learning Path**: These exercises are designed to be completed progressively, not all at once. Each section builds upon the previous one, requiring specific knowledge and skills that are developed through the exercises.

**How to use this lab:**
- **Start with Easy exercises** to build a solid foundation
- **Complete at least 6-8 Easy exercises** before moving to Intermediate
- **Master Intermediate concepts** before attempting Hard exercises
- **Focus on understanding** rather than rushing through exercises
- **Take breaks** between sections to consolidate learning

**Remember**: Each section has minimum requirements. Don't skip ahead - the knowledge you gain in earlier exercises is essential for success in more advanced scenarios.

## üü¢ Easy - Foundation Level

**Perfect for beginners** who are new to AWS IAM or need to solidify their understanding of basic concepts. These exercises focus on fundamental IAM principles and simple permission patterns.

**What you'll learn:**
- Basic IAM policy structure and syntax
- Simple allow/deny permission patterns
- Single-service access controls
- Fundamental S3 and VPC permissions

- Resource-based policies (bucket policies)
- IAM permissions boundaries

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of AWS services (S3, VPC, EC2)
**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours per exercise
**Key skills developed:** Policy writing, resource ARN construction, basic security principles

### 1. **Full S3 Access Within Account Only** *(Identity-Based Policy)*

#### üìã **Solution Implementation:**

**Policy File:** [`02-S3ReadOnlyAccessRestrictedbyPrefix.json`](02-S3ReadOnlyAccessRestrictedbyPrefix.json)

This policy implements prefix-based S3 access control with three distinct statements:
- **Bucket listing** with `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` for general bucket discovery
- **Prefix-restricted listing** using `s3:ListBucket` with `StringLike` condition for `2025/*` prefix
